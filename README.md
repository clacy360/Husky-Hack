Idea: The current UWB Events website does not differentiate events between faculty and students.
      This makes it difficult to reach both student and staff through independent channels.
      Many campus events through clubs are posted on various social media accounts that are not
      fully accessible to each student, and it is difficult to track down each individual event.
      Our goal was to create a separate site that focused soley on upcoming student events.
